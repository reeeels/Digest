# Digest

The goal of the project is to deliver a web application that delivers personalized news stories and topics to users.

## Project Description

- This will be a full stack web application that delivers top stories and news to registered users. Users will select news and stories topics they are interested in upon creating an account and registering. Users can add or remove what topics they want at any time and how frequent they want their roundups sent to them as they see fit. This will allow users tailor the app to their own needs and lifestyle. 
- When users select topics they are interested in, the app uses the API to fetch top and latest stories that the user will be able to view. And based on how frequent the user wants this delivered to them, the app works accordingly and fetches new stories at that specific time. This option can be changed.
- User data will be stored in a database (FireBase) and will be fetched upon request as users make requests and changes.
